# Repo Context

- Package manager: npm
- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- UI Components: shadcn/ui (components in `components/ui/`, config in `components.json`)
- Integration: Google Sheets API for data export

## App Structure

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/` - React components (shadcn/ui + custom)
- `lib/` - Utilities, API clients, data extraction logic
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks

## Key Features

- Data extraction from HTML forms, emails (.eml), and invoices (PDF)
- Human-in-the-loop approval workflows (approve/reject/edit)
- Dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Google Sheets integration for data export

## Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start dev server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - TypeScript type checking

## Behavior

- Be terse and direct. Give actual code, not high-level explanations.
- Be casual unless otherwise specified.
- Treat me as an expert - skip obvious explanations.
- Give the answer immediately, then provide context if needed.
- When I ask for code adjustments, show only the changed lines with context, not the entire file.
- Respect Prettier/ESLint preferences.
- Use server components by default, client components only when needed (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs).

## Cursor Rules Structure

This project uses Cursor's rules system:

- `.cursor/general.mdc` (alwaysApply: true) - Core tech stack, repo context, and behavior rules
- `.cursor/project-overview.mdc` - Business context and project requirements
- `.cursor/rules/coding-patterns.md` - TypeScript and Next.js coding patterns
- `.cursor/rules/design-patterns.md` - UI design system and component patterns

Cursor automatically reads these files to understand the project context.
